## Installing Docker

# Installing Docker

Docker is an open source platform for developing, shipping and running applications.

It allows to run any application regardless of the operating system.

## Important!  
- If you aren't familiar with Docker - don't worry! It's just used for running Airflow
- If you can't install Docker (or don't want to), you can still follow the prep course
- If you already have Airflow running on your computer, you can skip this part

# Steps
It's pretty straightforward:

1. Go to https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. Select your operating system
3. Follow the included instructions
4. Non-Windows users will need to install Docker Compose:
    - Go to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
    - As above, select your operating system and follow the instructions

# Well done!
