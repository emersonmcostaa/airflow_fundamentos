## Installing the Astro CLI


# Installing the Astronomer CLI

Astronomer's open source CLI is the easiest and fastest way to run Apache Airflow on your machine

Running on top of Docker, with two simple commands you get Airflow running

## Important!
- If you can't install the Astronomer CLI (or don't want to), you can still follow the prep course
- If you already have Airflow running on your computer, you can skip this part

# Steps
Like Docker, it's rather straightforward:  
> 1. Go to https://docs.astronomer.io/cloud/install-cli  
> 2. Follow the instructions relevant to your OS :)  

# You're ready!
